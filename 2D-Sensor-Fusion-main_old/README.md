# 2D-NON-CUDA-Sensor-Fusion

CUDA-free Implementation of Sensor Fusion combining Camera, LiDAR, and GPS data. Uses OpenCV and KITTI dataset. Integrates video support and all other functionality of my CUDA project, just without the CUDA.

Based on tooth2's 2D-Sensor-Fusion algorithm, found here: https://github.com/tooth2/2D-Sensor-Fusion
